# **Comparison Table: Traditional Models vs. Proposed Model**

| **Feature**                         | **Traditional Models**                                  | **Proposed Model**                                          |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Input**                      | Manual soil sample analysis (physical/chemical tests). | Digital images of soil.                                    |
| **Processing Method**               | Laboratory-based methods.                              | Machine learning (CNN) for image classification.           |
| **Accessibility**                   | Limited to labs and professionals.                     | Accessible through a web interface for all users.          |
| **Accuracy**                        | High but dependent on manual precision.                | High with consistent performance from trained ML models.    |
| **Time Efficiency**                 | Time-consuming (hours to days).                        | Fast (real-time or a few seconds for predictions).          |
| **Cost**                            | Expensive due to laboratory requirements.              | Cost-effective with minimal operational expenses.           |
| **Scalability**                     | Difficult to scale due to equipment and manpower needs.| Highly scalable through web hosting and cloud deployment.  |
| **User Interaction**                | Requires trained professionals.                        | Simple upload interface, suitable for non-technical users. |
| **Future Expansion**                | Limited to adding lab-based tests.                     | Easily expandable with IoT, mobile apps, and additional ML models. |
| **Error Handling**                  | Manual re-testing required.                            | Automated validation and error feedback to users.          |
